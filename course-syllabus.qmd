**Instructor: Dr. Allison Theobold** -- call me [**Dr. Theobold**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4e-2l76luAd9WrxiwCVf8-yf-co82dDSe1jHYf-NBo/edit?usp=sharing) or Dr. T! I use **they / she** pronouns (that is my order of preference).

# Welcoming Classroom

I value diversity, inclusion and equity in this (and every) class. I hold the fundamental belief that everyone is fully capable of learning and doing statistics. There is more than one way to address a statistical problem, and our learning will be richer by being open to different ideas, rejecting stereotypes, and being aware of---in order to minimize---our biases. I look forward to getting to know you all as individuals and as a learning community.

# What is this class?

*Catalog Description*: Modern methods and techniques in predictive modeling and classification including splines, smoothing splines, ridge regression, LASSO, regression and classification trees, generalized additive models, logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis. Model assessment and selection using cross validation, bootstrapping, AIC, and BIC. Use of the R programming language. Prerequisite: STAT 305 or STAT 350; STAT 331 or STAT 531; STAT 334; and graduate standing.

# Learning Objectives

This course will teach you to perform advanced machine learning and statistical modeling analyses.

After taking this course, you will be able to:

-   Perform analyses in R or python and report them with Quarto
-   Justify your choice of statistical learning model with cross-validated metrics and intuitive understanding.
-   Explain the philosophy behind various methods as well as metrics.

Additionally, it is my hope that you will learn to:

-   Contribute to and participate in the online Data Science community.
-   Be thoughtful, deliberate, and ethical in your data analysis.
-   Be playful, creative, and fun in your statistical learning applications.

# Course Organization

## Readings & Check-in Quizzes (10%)

**Due Mondays at the start of class**

I favor a "flipped classroom," as it gives you more time to clarify and solidify statistical concepts through hands-on exercises. Each week, you will read the required chapter(s), completing a required reading guide to walk you through the central concepts for each week. There will also be a short (\~10 questions) quiz over the reading from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the key concepts from the week's readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can feel free to check your answers with the textbook and / or videos if you so wish.

The reading guides and quizzes are **marked on completion** as complete or incomplete. You are required to complete both before the start of class (2:10pm) on Monday. I will plan our in-class lectures and work assuming you have met all prior deadlines.

## Activities (10%)

**Due Fridays at 5pm**

During class each week you will complete activities which give you an introduction to exploring the concepts you just read about in the context of real data. Activities will always be started in class, but you may not complete them before class is finished. You are strongly encouraged to work on these in groups, and sharing answers (within reason) is permitted.

Activities are also graded on completeness, not correctness. However, despite these points being "free", I encourage you to take them seriously.

## Labs (20%)

**Due Mondays at 5pm**

Every week, you'll complete a lab assignment that will push you conceptually and computationally to apply the techniques you learned each week to perform an analysis on real data. These assignments are usually individual work, although occasionally you are allowed to work with a partner. Typical homework rules apply: you are free to discuss ideas and solutions with each other, but you may not look at each other's written text or code.

You will access each week's assignment through Canvas, which you will walk through in Week 1. You will need to submit **only** your rendered HTML document. Labs will be graded as either Complete or Incomplete, based on the rubric described below.

#### Success / Growing Grading

Different from what you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for "proficiency" of specific learning targets, which describe what you should be able to do after taking this course. You'll receive a score for each problem on an assignment according to the **Success** / **Not Yet** rubric below, as well as feedback to help you improve.

| Score      | Justification                                                                                                           |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Successful | The solution to the problem is correct, legible, and easy to follow, with all reasoning provided. Any error is trivial. |
| Growing    | The solution shows growth toward mastering the topic; however, it is incorrect and/or incomplete.                       |

#### Completing Revisions

After the first submission of your assignment, you will have the option to retry any problems for which you scored a **Growing (G)**. A written reflection on how your understanding of the problem changed will accompany any revision. If you don't earn a **Success** by the second try, you can make an appointment with me to meet during my office hours (or another agreed-upon time) to create a reassessment strategy. You can schedule up to one meeting per week.

You can submit **up to one** revision a week.

#### Reflections on Your Learning

Revisions **must** include a reflection describing how you revised your thinking when completing your revision. It's not enough to say "\[x\] was wrong, so I fixed it"---you have to talk about why you got \[x\] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn't know before? Who or what helped you learn?

-   If your revision does not include reflections, I'll ask you to add them.
-   See some examples of really good reflections [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JNR3cVONeEPwe7umURI1gv0w9qbMz5fyC_S2_qXkHII/edit?usp=sharing) -- they're (mostly) from an introductory statistics class, but I think you'll get the idea.

**Submit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has.**

## Final Project (20%)

In this project, you will perform a Statistical Learning analysis that can be reasonably described as "Data for Good." That is, you are not only responsible for a correct and complete statistical analysis; you will also be asked to reflect on the specific uses and outcomes of your conclusions. The project will have various checkpoints throughout the quarter, which I will be sure to announce at least a week in advance.

## Midterm & Final Exams (20% each)

These will have a mix of in-person exams with conceptual questions and take-home data analyses. There will be a midterm exam in Week 7 (November 6-8). The conceptual portion of the final exam will take place on the last day of class (December 6) and the take-home exam will be due at scheduled time of our final exam (December 15, 4:00pm).

# Grade Breakdown

In this class we will be using a contract grading system. This is designed to
give flexibility and freedom to explore while ensuring a level of
accountability. Learning to write takes practice. I do not want worries about
grades to distract us from being creative, taking risks, and ultimately finding
our voices.

You are guaranteed a grade of a B for this class if you meet the following
conditions:

-   Submit all pre-class readings, concept quizzes, and class activities on time^[See @sec-late for information on deadline extensions]
with a maximum of 2 missed assignments.
-   Submit all lab assignments on time^[See @sec-late for information on deadline extensions] (no missed assignments)
-   Complete revisions on ___% of assignments where 
-   Obtain a "satisfactory" conditions of the rubric on **both** the conceptual
and application portions of the midterm exam. 
-   Submit the final project on time and meet the "satisfactory" conditions on
the rubric.
-   Obtain a "satisfactory" conditions of the rubric on **both** the conceptual
and application portions of the midterm exam. 

**Grade Deductions** 
Your grade will decrease by a third of a step (for example a B to a B-) for each
B condition that you do not meet. Missing assignments will be scaled, so that if
for example you miss six assignments, turn in two homework assignments late, or
turn in your final project late your grade will decrease by two thirds of a
step (for example a B to a C+).

Missing an exam or a project will result in a maximum grade of a C at the
instructor's discretion.

**Grade Boosters**
You can increase your letter grade by *up to* a third of a step (for example a B
to B+) for meeting each of the following conditions (further instructions will
be provided):

-   Select a data set from
    [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or [Makeover
    Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) and use the skills you've
    learned in this course to perform an analysis. You will be required to 
    submit your *tidy* analysis to the *Data Analysis - Booster* assignment
    portal.
-     Complete a final project that goes above and beyond the requirements. Your
job is to convince me in an additional one page document why you think your
contribution goes the extra mile.
<!-- -   I encourage you to suggest your own "boosting" condition via the suggestion -->
<!--     "box" form on Canvas. -->

For example, to earn an A in this class you must meet the conditions for a B and
complete three of the "boosting" conditions above to "satisfactory" quality.

Any deviation from the grading policies outlined above will only be to your
benefit.

# Classroom community and policies

### Weekly expectations

The module for each week will be released on Friday by 5pm, so you can look over the content and see what the plan is for the week.

### Getting help {#sec-help}

**Discord:** We will use Discord to manage questions and responses regarding course content. There are channels for the different components of each week (e.g., Week 1 Lab Assignment). Please **do not** send an email about homework questions or questions about the course material. It is incredibly helpful for others in the course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions. I will try to answer any questions posted to Discord within 3-4 hours (unless it is posted at midnight). If you think you can answer another student's question, please respond!

**Email:** I do my best to reply to emails promptly and helpfully. However, I receive *a lot* of emails. To help both you and me, here are some specific expectations about emails:

-   If you email me between 8am and 4pm on Monday through Friday, I'll try my best to reply to you on the *same* day.
-   If you email me outside of those hours, I will do my best to respond to you by the *next working* day. For my own mental health, I **do not** work on weekends. Thus, if you send an email after 4pm on Friday or during the weekend, you will not receive a response until Monday morning.
-   If your question is much easier to discuss face-to-face, I may ask you to meet with me in my office or on Discord (at a time that works for both of us) rather than answering directly in an email.
-   Include any relevant photos / screenshots / error messages / PDFs / links with your email.

# Well-being, Access, and Accommodations

## What if I have accommodations or feel that accommodations would be beneficial to my learning?

I enthusiastically support the mission of Disability Resource Center to make education accessible to all. I design all my courses with accessibility at the forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let's talk to each other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal processes.

## I'm having difficulty paying for food and rent, what can I do?

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.

## My mental health is impairing my ability to engage in my classes, what should I do?

National surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly are here to help you. Cal Poly's Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy.

## Someone is threatening me, what can I do?

I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to dating violence and stalking.

## What if I can't arrange for childcare?

If you are responsible for childcare on short notice, you are welcome to bring children to class with you. If you are a lactating parent, you many take breaks to feed your infant or express milk as needed. If I can support yo in navigating parenting, coursework, and other obligations in any way, please let me know.

# Attendance, Extensions, and Technology

## What if I need to miss class?

I encourage you to attend every class session, but policies are for narcs. I put a great deal of time into making each class session engaging and worth your time. Attendance in this course is not explicitly required, but it degrades your team's trust in you when they don't see you in class.

Here's what you should do if you do miss a class:

-   Talk to a classmate to figure out what information you missed
-   Check Canvas for any necessary handouts or changes to assignments
-   Email me with any questions you have after reviewing notes and handouts

If you miss a bunch of classes, please come talk to me. I'm working from the assumption that you care and are trying, but something is getting in your way (health issues? depression / anxiety? college stress?); let's figure out what that is and how I can help.

## What if I need to turn something in late? {#sec-late}

Assignments are expected to be submitted on time. However, every student will be permitted to submit up to **three** individual assignments up to 3-days late, by completing the [deadline extension form](https://forms.gle/CXsNoSbkoacs28cG7). [Similar to the "real world," deadline extensions must be requested **before** an assignment is due.]{style="color: #FF0000;"}

When you complete the deadline extension form you will be required to state (1) what assignment you need an extension for, and (2) your proposed new deadline. **Your new deadline must be within 3-days of the original deadline.**

**All** deadline extensions must be done through the form, so I can keep track of who has used their allotment of extensions. If you are registered with DRC to have deadline extensions, you are required to complete a deadline extension request and make a note if your extension is related to a disability related need.

Any late work is required to have a deadline extension request, meaning if you do not complete a deadline extension request for an assignment you **are not** permitted to turn it in late.

## Do I need to bring a computer to class?

You are allowed to use technology in the classroom! In fact, we will often do so as part of in-class activities. However, our class is held in a computer laboratory, so bringing a laptop is not required. You are permitted to use the lab computers, but if you would like to take notes on your computer / surface you are welcome to bring it to class.

# Expectations, Respect, and Integrity

## How can I expect to be treated in this course?

Following Ihab Hassan, I strive to teach statistics so that people will stop killing each other. In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. **Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course.** Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. **So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect.** Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).

In summary: Be good to each other.

## What constitutes plagiarism in a programming class?

Paraphrasing or quoting another's work without citing the source is a form of academic misconduct. This included the `R` code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.

Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with writing the `R` code for an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere!

Any incident of dishonesty, copying or plagiarism will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Cheating or plagiarism will earn you a grade of **N** on the problem or assignment and will remove your ability to submit revisions for that assignment.

If you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.

For more information about what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see <https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating>.

# California Faculty Association

The California Faculty Association (the labor union of Lecturers, Professors, Coaches, Counselors, and Librarians across the 23 CSU campuses) is in a difficult contract dispute with California State University management. It is possible that we will call a strike or other work stoppage this term. I promise to promptly inform you of any schedule disruption. Our working conditions are your learning conditions; we seek to protect both. For further information go to [www.CFAbargaining.org](https://www.cfabargaining.org/).
