## Setup

Declare your libraries:

```{r}
#| label: packages
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(glmnet)
library(discrim)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(baguette)
```

# Try it!

Recall: We wanted to predict the `Type` of cannabis from the descriptor words.

Consider only Indica vs. Sativa  (remove Hybrid)

Can you combine **logistic regression** with **LASSO** to tell me which words best separate Indica and Sativa?

How does this compare to what you find with a decision tree?

```{r}

cann <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/s2a1uoiegitupjc/cannabis_full.csv?dl=1")

cann <- cann %>%
  select(-Strain, -Effects, -Flavor, -Dry, -Mouth)

cann_no_hybrid <- cann %>%
  filter(Type != "Hybrid")

```
