Additionally, the ethical guidelines aim to promote accountability by informing those who rely on statistical analysis of the standards they should expect.

## Data Science Oath

::: {.smaller}

> I will respect the privacy of my data subjects, for their data are not disclosed to me that the world may know, so I will tread with care in matters of privacy and security.

> I will remember that my data are not just numbers without meaning or context, but represent real people and situations, and that my work may lead to unintended societal consequences, such as inequality, poverty, and disparities due to algorithmic bias.
