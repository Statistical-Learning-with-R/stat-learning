## Data Ethics

In Homework 4, you were asked to use statistical modeling to predict credit defaults,
and to report your results to Data Science or Business audiences.

Reports focused on the error rates of the models and the most imporant coefficients. 
But all of these discussions were missing a critical aspect of assessing model 
implications -- humans. Thus, this week we are reading a chapter from *Data Feminism* 
(D'Ignazio & Klein, 2020) that specifically interrogates the importance of considering 
context in any data analysis.
