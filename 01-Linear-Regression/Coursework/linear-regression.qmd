The second reading for this week covers the highlights of linear regression. This content of this chapter should be a review to everyone, but keep your eye out for sections where the authors highlight ways to think about regression from the statistical learning perspective.

# Concept Quiz

\[ISLR exercise 3.3\]

Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, X1 = GPA, X2 = IQ, X3 = Gender (1 for Female and 0 for Male), X4 = Interaction between GPA and IQ, and X5 = Interaction between GPA and Gender. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $\hat{\beta_0} = 50$, $\hat{\beta_1} = 20$, $\hat{\beta_2} = 0.07$, $\hat{\beta_3} = 35$, $\hat{\beta_4} = 0.01$, $\hat{\beta_5} = ‚àí10$.

**Question 1** -- Which answer is correct?

-   For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females.

-   For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males.

-   For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females provided that the GPA is high enough.

-   For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males provided that the GPA is high enough.

# Write out the model!

It would be **really** helpful if you wrote out the full model with the coefficient estimates!
:::

**Question 2** -- Predict the salary of a female with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0. (Round your answer to the nearest dollar)

**Question 3** -- True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect.
