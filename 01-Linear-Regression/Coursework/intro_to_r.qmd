# Step 1: Installing `R` and RStudio

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Checking your R version

If you already have `R` downloaded, you need to confirm that you have the most up to date version of `R`. **Do not ignore these instructions.** If you neglect to update your version of R, you may find that updating a package will make it so your code will not run.

-   Step 1: Open RStudio
-   Step 2: At the top of the the Console it will say what version of R you are using

> R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13) -- "Great Square Root" Copyright (C) 2025 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20

If the version **is not** 4.5.1, you need to update your version of R!

## Install or Update R

Download and install R by going to <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.

If you are a **Windows** user:

-   Click on "Download R for Windows"

-   Click on "base"

-   Click on the Download link.

If you are **macOS** user:

-   Click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X"

-   If you have an M1-M3 Mac, under "Latest release:" click on R-X.X.X-arm64.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

-   If you have an Intel Mac (typically purchased before 2016), under "Latest release:" click on R-X.X.X-x86_64.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

If you are a **Linux** user:

Click on "Download R for Linux" and choose your distribution for more information on installing `R` for your setup.

# Remove old version

If you are updating your version of R, make certain the old version is removed from your computer. If you have two versions of R, your computer will automatically run the older version!

## Troubleshooting

If you would like a video tutorial on installing R, here is one: <https://vimeo.com/203516510>

**Troubleshooting for Macs**

First, identify which version of OSx you are running. [How-to](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260)

Next, find out which version of `R` your computer can run. [Link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

If this version is 3.5 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.

If this version is 3.4 or earlier, you're going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can't, then you can use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) to run `R` and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.

## Install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`. What does that mean? Well, if you think of `R` as a language, which it is, you can think of RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio makes programming in `R` much easier and this course requires you to use it!

If you already have RStudio, you still need to make sure you have the most recent version. You **cannot** create Quarto documents (what we will live and breathe) unless you have a recent version of RStudio.

-   Step 1: Open RStudio
-   Step 2: Click on "Help" in the upper menu
-   Step 3: Click on "Check for Updates"

If there are no updates to RStudio since you installed it, you are good to go! If you need to update RStudio, you will be sent to Posit (the parent company) to download the most recent version of RStudio desktop.

RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

# Installing Packages

### How to install R packages

‚ñ∂Ô∏è[Required Video: Installing R Packages (4 minutes)](http://youtu.be/tXZDoMlXfTE?hd=1)

### Install / Update the tidyverse

Now that you have the hang of working in RStudio, let's install / update the packages we will use in the course.

In this course, we will make heavy use of the **tidyverse** and **tidymodels** suite of packages.

If you **have not** used the tidyverse and / or tidymodels packages before, type the following into your **console** or use the drop down menu in the **Packages** tab:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidymodels")
```

If you **have** used the tidyverse or tidymodels packages before, you only need to update packages.\
Type the following into your console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse_update()

library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_update()
```
