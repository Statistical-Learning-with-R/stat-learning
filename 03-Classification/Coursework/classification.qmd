This week we will focus on classification, using both parametric and nonparametric methods. We will break apart the chapter into two installments, starting with *simple* parametric methods (logistic regression), then moving to more *complex* parametric methods (linear discriminant analysis) and then nonparametric methods (KNN). 

# Logistic Regression

## Textbook Reading

üìñ [**Required Reading:** *ISLR -- Chapter 4, Sections 4.1-4.3 Classification*](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_corrected_June_2023.pdf)

::: callout-warning
# Only Logistic Regression

Read pages 129 through 141, stopping after multinomial logistic regression. Also read section 4.6 on the applications of generalized linear models (pages 164 - 170).
