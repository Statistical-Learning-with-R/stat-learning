## Chapter : Statistical Learning)

**What is "reducible error" in statistical learning?**

**Can all error be taken out of a model predicting y? Why not?**

**What is the difference between inferential modeling and predictive modeling?**

**What are the differences between parametric and non-parametric models?**

**What are the advantages to using parametric methods? What are the disadvantages?**

**What is it called when a highly specific (flexible) model is fit to a training dataset?**

**What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**

**Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error curves on *one* plot.** The x-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the y-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five total curves! Make sure to label each curve, so I know what it corresponds with.
