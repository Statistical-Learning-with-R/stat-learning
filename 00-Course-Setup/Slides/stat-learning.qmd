# What is Statistical Learning?

## Modeling

Every analysis we will do assumes a structure like:

:::{.centered}
[**output** = [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"}(**input**) + (noise)]{.large}
:::

. . .

</br>

...or, if you prefer...

:::{.centered}
[**response variable(s)** = [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"}(**explanatory variables**) + (noise)]{.midi}
:::

. . .

:::{.centered}
[**dependent variable(s)** = [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"}(**independent variables**) + (noise)]{.midi}
:::

. . .

:::{.centered}
[**target** = [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"}(**predictors**) + (noise)]{.midi}
:::

# Modeling

In any case: we are trying to reconstruct information in **data**, and we are hindered by **random noise**.

. . .

...or very complex

$z_i = b_o + b_1 x_i$

$q_i = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-z_i)}$

$y_i \sim Bern(q_i)$

# This or That?

## Statistical Learning vs. Machine Learning

You will often hear people refer to **machine learning** in reference to the topics in this class.

. . .

</br>

[My opinion:]{.larger}

**Statistical learning** is more concerned with the *model structure*, *interpretation of estimates*,  and *understanding error*.

. . .

**Machine learning** is more concerned with *model implementation* and *computational demands*.

## Quantitative (numeric) vs. qualitative (categorical)

Often, the nature of our models will differ depending on the types of data involved!

</br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
[**regression**]{style="color: #e28743; font-size: 1.25em"} 

the response variables are *quantitative*
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
[**classification**]{style="color: #76b5c5; font-size: 1.25em"}

the response variables are *categorical*
:::
:::

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised

</br>

**supervised** learning: our data includes observations of the output variable

> What drug treatments are associated with better disease outcomes?

. . .

</br>

**unsupervised** learning: our data does NOT include any observations of the output variable

> What social groups already exist among the Stat 551 students?

# Prediction vs. Inference

So, why do we care about estimating [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"}?

. . .

**prediction**: We are trying to use future **inputs** to guess about future **outputs**.

> Which articles are Dr. T. most likely to read?

. . .

**inference**: We are trying to tell a story about the **relationship** between variables.

> Which genes are more activated when breast cancer is present?

# What do we need to learn?

## Why not just "plug and chug"?

It is important to think carefully about:

:::{.incremental}
* **Assumptions:** What do various models assume to be true about the data structure?  Are these justified?

* **Interpretations:** What can we learn by estimating [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"} for a particular model?  Is that information what we are looking for?

* **Estimation:** How is each [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"} being approximated?  Will this be a close approximation?

* **Usage:** What are we going to do once we estimate [f]{style="color: #abdbe3; font-size: 1.25em"}?  Do certain models lend themselves better than others?

## Estimation

If we are doing [prediction]{.underline}, we mostly don't care about *assumptions*.

. . .

The "best" model is the model that predicts most accurately.

. . .

But: What measure of *accuracy* do we prioritize?

. . .

</br>

If we are doing [inference]{.underline}, we care a lot about *assumptions*.

. . .

The "best" model is the one that matches the truth.

. . .

But:  What the heck is the *truth*???

# In this Class

You will learn:

- To apply many different models to real data using **R**.

- To interpret the output of these model estimates

- To use *cross-validation* to compare models

- To explain the general structure and philosophy behind each model

- To select an appropriate "best" model for a data analysis, and make a well-reasoned argument for your choice.
