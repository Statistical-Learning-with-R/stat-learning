## A Preview of What's to Come

In the second part of the assignment you are tasked with finding the "best" model and reporting that model to different interested parties. While this is a very open ended task, it is similar to the task(s) you will be faced with on the midterm and out in the wild.

::: callout-caution
Similar to previous assignments, I would like your **entire** analysis to be reproducible. So, I request that you include **all** the code you used when selecting your model.
