## Chapter 5: Cross Validation

1. What is the purpose of cross-validation?

2. Why are the curves in Figure 5.2 (right hand side) so variable? 

3. Describe to someone what leave-one-out cross validation is.

::: {.callout-tip}
You can assume the person is familiar with linear regression. Your description 
should address the following questions:

- What data are used when fitting the model?
- What is calculated about each model?
- How many models are fit?

4. Why does LOOCV have less bias than the validation approach?

5. In what scenarios is LOOCV too "expensive" to implement?

6. LOOCV is a special case of k-Fold cross validation when k is set to ___.

7. What are "typical" choices of k in k-Fold CV?

8. Which method (LOOCV or k-Fold CV) has higher bias? Why?

9. Which method (LOOCV or k-Fold CV) has higher variance? Why?
